# Contributing to the Official MineZ Resource Pack
Do you have some textures or other resources you'd like added to the game? Here's your chance! 
The community is one of the most important parts of MineZ, and that includes adding to the game mode.

Below you'll find guidelines for contributing to the resource pack. Following these guidelines makes it easier for everyone involved, and greatly increases the chance that your contributing will be implemented.

## Code of Conduct

All resources (textures, models, properties files, etc.) must be your original hand-made work. Resources from any other sources are not acceptable.
Additionally, all contributions must fall in line with Shotbow Network rules, meaning, among other things, no inappropriate or offensive content.
Failure to adhere to this will result in your contributing being rejected and potential disciplinary action.

## What do I need before I get started?
 
 * General knowledge of Minecraft resource packs and their structure, which can be found [here](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Resource_Pack)
 * A pixel art editor for creating textures, such as GIMP, found [here](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/)
 * Knowledge of Optifine's CIT system, which can be found [here](https://github.com/sp614x/optifine/blob/master/OptiFineDoc/doc/cit_single.properties)

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Sometimes things might slip through the cracks and while you're playing MineZ, you might come across an issue with a texture, or something that doesn't look quite right. It's possible you've run into a bug. 

If this happens to you, go to the [Issues](https://github.com/Shotbow/minez-official-textures/issues) tab, and see if someone else has reported this issue. 
  * If they have, there's nothing else you need to do!
  * If they haven't, go ahead and create a new issue. When doing so, be sure to include your Minecraft version, any mods or clients (Lunar, Badlion, etc.) you're using, and a detailed description of what you saw. Then choose an appropriate label and create the issue.

### Suggesting Enhancements

We're always welcome to hear feedback, and this is your place to give it!

If you have something you think would be cool added to the pack, or a suggesting for a change to a texture or model, go to the [Issues](https://github.com/Shotbow/minez-official-textures/issues) tab, and see if someone else has suggested something similar.
  * If they have, even if it's been rejected, there's nothing else you need to do.
  * If they haven't, go ahead and create a new issue. When doing so, be sure to include a detailed description of your suggesting. Then choose an appropriate label and create the issue.

### Pull Requests

If you'd like to do more than just report bugs or suggest new features, and instead want to fix bugs and add new features, then you're going to want to make a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

When adding files, be sure to follow the file format of the pack. 
  * If you only want to replace or change an image, put your replacement image in the same location as the original with the same name and format.
  * If you are adding a new item, create its folder under the appropriate category, and create a separate folder with its name. Then create a .properties file for it, along with its texture/s. 

For examples of how to structure your files and setup the properties files, using the existing parts of the pack as templates.
