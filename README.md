# The Library - MineZ Official Textures
Provides a Vanilla+ resource pack for the MineZ gamemode, relying heavily on Optifine's CIT system. The pack contains original custom textures for all legendary items, unique items, enchanted items, potions, and more. 

## Installation
1. Download the latest version of the pack from the "Releases" corresponding to your Minecraft version. 
2. Put the zip file in the "resourcepacks" folder of your Minecraft instance.
3. Move it to the right-hand column of the resource pack selection screen in-game. For best results ensure the pack is at the top of the list of active resource packs.

## Addon Packs
With each release there are additional packs aside from the main one. These addon packs modify the main pack or the MineZ experience. The goal of these is to provide additional customization for the user. To use any of the addon packs, follow the installation instructions for the main pack, and then set it above the main pack in the list of active resource packs.

### Available Addon Packs
- Fishing Pack: Changes the water splash texture from blue to yellow, to make fishing splashes much more visible.
