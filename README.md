Home of "The Library - MineZ Official Textures" official resource pack for Shotbow's MineZ gamemode.

Provides a Vanilla+ resource pack for the MineZ gamemode, relying heavily on Optifine's CIT system. The pack contains original custom textures for all legendary items, unique items, enchanted items, potions, and more. 

To use, download the latest version of the pack from the "Releases" corresponding to your Minecraft version. Once downloaded, put the zip file in the "resourcepacks" folder of your Minecraft instance. Then move it to the right hand column of the resource pack selection screen in-game. For best results ensure the pack is at the top of the list of active resource packs.
